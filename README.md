#SURVEILLANCE ROBOT USING MICROCONTROLLER

Part of my Final Project of my senior year as an undergad in Computer Science

The robot has 2 operating modes:

Autonomous mode: 
Designed and implemented a platform on servo-motor wheels carrying proximity and
PIR sensors, for obstacles avoidance and monitoring using Arduino board.

Remote mode: 
Addition of WIFI board and implementation of TCP/IP based communication between the
Î¼C and native Android app responsible for the remote control of the robot. o The project was implemented in C and Java.
